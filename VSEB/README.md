Makes money

## Important Notes
This program should only be run the morning of the first day you'd like to make buys. So if you want the first day you trade stocks today make sure to check that:
A) the market is open today
and B) that you run it sometime in the morning before ~3pm.

Finally, it might be a good idea to do a "hard" refresh of this program every three months or so
or as the user desires to update its ticker list.
