TO DO:

*current*--make VSEB as backtested in "BackTestingVSEB"v0.1
--Next backtests should include stop loss (pretty easy to do even with v0.1)
--Then: Make backtesting program all around better /re-write to be good
--Do the same with RDF, maybe even before above
--Rewrite VSEB based off of results from above, (above should be able to optimize for best values of stop loss, take profit, delay between buy/sell, etc.)

*I* concurrent with above, make detailed docs and explanation of programs. (First with v1.0 of VSEB, then with the new backtester and RDF as well as eventually with the new trader) *I*
