TO DO:

*current*--make VSEB as backtested in "BackTestingVSEB"v0.1
--Next backtests should include stop loss (pretty easy to do even with v0.1)
--Then: Make backtesting program all around better /re-write to be good
--Do the same with RDF, maybe even before above
--Rewrite VSEB based off of results from above, (above should be able to optimize for best values of stop loss, take profit, delay between buy/sell, etc.)

IDEAS TO MAKE MORE MONEY

--VSEB but on the way down as well with shorts
--Buy if pre-market price skyrocketted (esp. with news of new earnings, etc.)
