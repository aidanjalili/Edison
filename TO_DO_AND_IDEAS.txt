TO DO:

--Lmao low key remake everything

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEAS TO MAKE MORE MONEY^*

--Buy if pre-market price skyrocketted (esp. with news of new earnings, etc.)
--Short but daily, early in day if it's spiked, and sell at end of day or tmrw or two days ltr or something
--perhaps buy after I've covered my short from shortie...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEAS FOR FEATURES OF VSEBV1.0

--make a function called AlertUser() or smthg that is sent when/if the algo is forced to stop
--for whatever reason
--it could like text me or smthg and include a message abt the currently purchased assets
		--- This will be in a separate file, and make the worst type of error defined to also send an email/phone call, but also automatically sells everything.
--Once we start running things in parallel we r going to have to split up the money... prolly w/ a communal file that updates with how much money is needed for other things, and each can have its own simulated cash by subtracting the cash needed for other things
